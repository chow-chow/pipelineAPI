# PipelineAPI üê≥‚ò∏Ô∏è

This application exemplifies how to automate the building of an infrastructure for the development and monitoring of metrics for a REST API in a microservices environment using Kubernetes (k8s-kind) and Helm Charts.

## Dependencies

This project uses [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) to manage dependencies. The required tools and their versions are specified in the `.tool-versions` file. You can automatically provision these tools by running the following command:

```bash
asdf install
```

For a more comprehensive guide, check how to add [`plugins`](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/plugins.html) and install [`versions`](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/versions.html).

## Startup

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
make start
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki-Promtail, Postgres) alongside the API deployment within the cluster. 

If you want to take down the cluster, run:

```bash
make stop
```

If you encounter the error `too many open files` inside Promtail pods, try the following commands to increase the limits:

```bash
sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.max_user_instances=1024
sudo sysctl -w fs.file-max=1000000
ulimit -n 1000000
```
